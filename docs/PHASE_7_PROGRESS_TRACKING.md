## Decisions Made

### Decision 1: Start with Core Fields
**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Decision:** Deploy 50 core fields first before extended fields  
**Rationale:** Establishes foundation, enables core monitoring quickly  
**Impact:** Faster time to initial value

### Decision 2: Phased Pilot Approach
**Date:** February 8, 2026  
**Decision:** Start with 5-10 devices, expand to 25-50, then 100+  
**Rationale:** Controlled rollout reduces risk  
**Impact:** Longer timeline but safer deployment

---

## Next Actions

### Immediate (Now)
1. Create field creation guide for 50 core fields
2. Generate field definitions with exact specifications
3. Document field relationships

### Today (February 8, 2026)
1. Complete Task 1.1 planning documentation
2. Prepare for field creation execution

### Tomorrow (February 9, 2026)
1. Begin field creation in NinjaRMM (requires tenant access)
2. Validate field creation
3. Start Task 1.2 (script deployment)

---

## Notes

- Phase 7 is execution-focused and requires NinjaRMM tenant access
- Autonomous progress tracking documents can be created
- Actual deployment requires manual execution or API access
- Documentation and planning can proceed autonomously
