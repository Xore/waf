# Development Archive

This directory contains historical documentation from the development and conversion phases of the WAF framework.

## Purpose

These documents track the evolution of the framework but are not needed for production deployment or operations. They are preserved for historical reference and audit purposes.

## Contents

- **phase-tracking/** - Phase completion summaries and progress tracking
- **conversion-logs/** - Field conversion and standardization logs
- **session-logs/** - Development session summaries

## Note

All content in this archive is preserved in git history. These files were moved during the February 2026 repository reorganization to streamline production documentation.

For production documentation, see:
- [Main Documentation](../../docs/)
- [Reference Suite](../../docs/reference/)
- [Quick Start Guide](../../docs/QUICK_START.md)
