.SYNOPSIS
    Checks whether a file is present and if it has been updated within your specified time frame or fails a hash check.
.DESCRIPTION
    Checks whether a file is present and if it has been updated within your specified time frame or fails a hash check.

PARAMETER: -Alert "Alert If Change" or -Alert "Alert If No Change"
    Raise an alert if the file has or hasn't been modified based on your other parameters.

PARAMETER: -Hash "REPLACEMEC32D73431CED24FF114B2A216671C60117AF5012B40"
    The hash or checksum to verify that the file hasn't been modified.
PARAMETER: -Algorithm "SHA256"
    The hashing algorithm used for your inputted hash.
.EXAMPLE
    -Path "C:\TestFile.txt" -Hash "REPLACEME04C6F26CC32D73431CED24FF114B2A216671C60117AF5012B40" -Alert "Alert If No Change"

    C:\TestFile.txt exists!
    Hash Given: REPLACEME04C6F26CC32D73431CED24FF114B2A216671C60117AF5012B40
    Current Hash: 35BAFB1CE99AEF3AB068AFBAABAE8F21FD9B9F02D3A9442E364FA92C0B3EEEF0
    Hash mismatch!

.EXAMPLE
    -Path "C:\TestFile.txt" -Hash "35BAFB1CE99AEF3AB068AFBAABAE8F21FD9B9F02D3A9442E364FA92C0B3BEEF0" -Alert "Alert If No Change"

    C:\TestFile.txt exists!
    Hash Given: 35BAFB1CE99AEF3AB068AFBAABAE8F21FD9B9F02D3A9442E364FA92C0B3BEEF0
    Current Hash: 35BAFB1CE99AEF3AB068AFBAABAE8F21FD9B9F02D3A9442E364FA92C0B3BEEF0
    Hash matches!
    [Alert] File has not been modified!

PARAMETER: -Days "REPLACEMEWITHANUMBER"
    Raise an alert if the file hasn't been modified within the specified number of days. 
    Minutes and Hours are added to this time.

PARAMETER: -Hours "REPLACEMEWITHANUMBER"
    Raise an alert if the file hasn't been modified within the specified number of hours. 
    Days and Minutes are added to this time.

PARAMETER: -Minutes "REPLACEMEWITHANUMBER"
    Raise an alert if the file hasn't been modified within the specified number of minutes. 
    Days and Hours are added to this time.
.EXAMPLE
    -Path "C:\TestFile.txt" -Days 365 -Alert "Alert If Change"

    C:\TestFile.txt exists!
    Checking if the file was modified in the last 365 day(s) 00 hour(s) 00 minute(s)
    File was last modified on 02/07/2024 14:59:56.
    File has been updated within the time period.
    [Alert] File has been modified!
.EXAMPLE
    -Path "C:\TestFile.txt" -Days 30 -Alert "Alert If Change"

    C:\TestFile.txt exists!
    Checking if the file was modified in the last 30 day(s) 00 hour(s) 00 minute(s)
    File was last modified on 05/15/2023 15:13:55.
    File has not been modified within the time period.
