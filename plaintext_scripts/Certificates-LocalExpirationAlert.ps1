    Alerts if a certificate is set to expire within the specified number of days.
.EXAMPLE
    -DaysUntilExpiration "366"

PARAMETER: -MustBeValidBefore "ReplaceWithNumber"
    Only alert on certificates that are older than X days. This is primarily to silence alerts about certificates that were only valid for 24 hours in their entire lifetime.

PARAMETER: -Cutoff "ReplaceWithNumber"
    Don't alert on certificates that have been expired for longer than X days (default is 91 days).

PARAMETER: -IgnoreSelfSignedCerts
    Ignore certificates where the subject of the certificate and the issuer of the certificate are identical.
