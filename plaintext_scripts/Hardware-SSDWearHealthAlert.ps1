.SYNOPSIS
    Conditional script that helps determine if an SSD drive is failing or has failed.
.DESCRIPTION
    Conditional script that helps determine if an SSD drive is failing or has failed.

    A wear % of 100% indicates that the estimated wear level as been reached.

    Do note that some drives don't report all the needed details to the OS.
        This can be caused by a RAID card, settings in the BIOS, or the drive it self.
.PARAMETER WearLevelPercentMax
    The max estimated wear level percentage to fail at.
    The default is 80 %.
.EXAMPLE
     -WearLevelPercentMax 90
    Fail if SSD is found to have used 90% of its estimated wear leveling.
.OUTPUTS
    None
.NOTES
    Minium Supported OS: Windows 10, Server 2016
    Version: 1.1
    Release Notes: Updated Calculated Name
