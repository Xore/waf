Premature Replacement Waste:
  - 20 devices replaced 1 year early
  - Lost value: 1 year depreciation @ 20% = $240/device
  - Annual waste: 20 × $240 = $4,800

Late Replacement Cost:
  - 30 devices replaced after failure
  - Productivity loss during failure: 2 days @ $100/day = $200
  - Emergency procurement premium: 15% × $1,200 = $180
  - Annual excess cost: 30 × ($200 + $180) = $11,400

Framework Impact:
  - Predictive replacement forecasting (0-6, 6-12, 12-24 months)
  - Optimize replacement timing
  - Expected improvement: 80% move to optimal window

Value Calculation:
  Premature waste eliminated: $4,800 × 0.80 = $3,840
  Late replacement costs eliminated: $11,400 × 0.80 = $9,120
  Budget optimization: $12,960/year

Additional Value:
  - Better resale value: $50/device × 80 devices = $4,000
