| Framework Deployment | €7,250 | One-time (Month 1-2) |
| **Total Year 1 Costs** | **€13,250** | |

### Year 1 Benefits (€22,000)

#### 1. Operational Efficiency Savings (€8,250/year)

**A. Script Maintenance Reduction: €2,500/year**
```
Without Framework:
  - Manual monitoring: 150h/month
  - Annual: 1,800h/year

With Framework (automated):
  - Automated monitoring: 43h/month
  - Annual: 516h/year

Savings: 50h/year × €50/h = €2,500
```

**B. Troubleshooting Time Savings: €3,750/year**
```
Traditional RMM (no framework):
  - Diagnostic time: 20 min/ticket
  - 100 tickets/month = 33.3h/month
  - Annual: 400h

RMM + Framework:
  - Diagnostic time: 3 min/ticket (health scores)
  - 100 tickets/month = 5h/month
  - Annual: 60h

Savings: 340h/year (conservative: 75h)
Value: 75h × €50/h = €3,750
```

**C. False Positive Reduction: €2,000/year**
```
Traditional RMM:
  - 30% false positive rate
  - 500 alerts/month × 30% = 150 false positives
  - Investigation: 15 min each
  - Annual waste: 450h

RMM + Framework (hybrid conditions):
  - 10% false positive rate (70% reduction)
  - 500 alerts/month × 10% = 50 false positives
  - Annual waste: 150h

Savings: 300h (conservative: 40h)
Value: 40h × €50/h = €2,000
```

#### 2. Downtime Prevention (€5,000/year)

**A. Proactive Capacity Management: €3,000/year**
```
Without Predictive Capacity (CAPDaysUntilDiskFull):
  - 2 critical outages/year
  - 100 users × 4h downtime × €25/h = €10,000
  - Emergency response: €600
  - Total: €21,200/year

With Framework Prediction:
  - 30-day advance warning
  - Planned maintenance (zero downtime)
  - Cost: €100/incident

Annual Savings: €21,100 (conservative: €3,000)
```

**B. Predictive Hardware Replacement: €2,000/year**
```
Without MLFailureRisk:
  - 10 reactive failures/year
  - Emergency cost: €1,400/device
  - Annual: €14,000

With MLFailureRisk (30-day advance):
  - 75% predicted (7.5 devices)
  - Planned replacement: €1,000/device
  - Savings: €400/device × 7.5 = €3,000

Conservative first-year: €2,000
```

#### 3. Security Improvements (€3,000/year)

**A. ML Anomaly Detection (Security): €2,000/year**
```
Without ML:
  - 10 security incidents/year
  - Cost per incident: €1,000
  - Annual: €10,000

With MLAnomalyScore:
  - 30% reduction (early detection)
  - 7 incidents/year × €1,000 = €7,000

Savings: €3,000 (conservative: €2,000)
```

**B. Faster Incident Response (RCA): €1,000/year**
```
Without Automated RCA:
  - MTTR: 8 hours/incident
  - 7 incidents × 8h × €75/h = €4,200

With Automated RCA:
  - MTTR: 1 hour/incident (87.5% reduction)
  - 7 incidents × 1h × €75/h = €525

Savings: €3,675 (conservative: €1,000)
```

#### 4. ML/RCA Specific Value (€5,750/year)

**A. Ransomware Prevention: €4,000/year**
```
Industry Risk:
  - 20% chance/year of ransomware
  - Average SMB cost: €100,000
  - Annual risk: €20,000

Without ML Detection:
  - 24-72h detection time
  - Expected loss: €20,000

With MLAnomalyScore:
  - 15-minute detection

  - Expected loss: €4,000

Risk Reduction Value: €16,000
Conservative (1-year amortized): €4,000
```

**B. Automated RCA Time Savings: €1,750/year**
```
Complex Incidents: 35/year

Manual RCA:
  - 4 hours/incident
  - 35 × 4h = 140h × €50/h = €7,000

Automated RCA:
  - 30 min human review
  - 35 × 0.5h = 17.5h × €50/h = €875

Savings: €6,125 (conservative 40% adoption: €1,750)
```

## COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS

### Option 1: RMM Only (No Framework)

```
Annual Cost:              €6,000 (NinjaRMM)
Benefits:                 €0 (baseline operations)
Operational Losses:       €31,200/year (downtime, incidents)
Net Annual:               -€25,200
5-Year Total Cost:        €186,000 (platform + losses)
```

### Option 2: RMM + Framework v4.0

```
Year 1 Cost:              €13,250
Year 1 Benefits:          €22,000
Year 1 Net:               €8,750

5-Year Cost:              €37,250
5-Year Benefits:          €87,000
5-Year Net:               €49,750
```

**Advantage:** €49,750 better than RMM-only over 5 years

### Option 3: Enterprise Platform (Datadog @ €25/device/month)

```
Annual Cost:              €30,000 (100 devices × €25 × 12)
Benefits:                 €12,000 (partial - no RMM integration)
Net Annual:               -€18,000

5-Year Cost:              €150,000
5-Year Net:               -€90,000 (negative ROI)
```

**Advantage:** Framework is €139,750 better than Datadog over 5 years

---

## BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS

### Minimum Benefits Required (100 Devices)

**Year 1 Breakeven:**
```
Required Benefits = Year 1 Costs = €13,250
Projected Benefits = €22,000
Margin of Safety = (€22,000 - €13,250) / €22,000 = 40%
```

**Interpretation:** Benefits can drop 40% and still break even in Year 1

### What Single Event Justifies Investment?

**Option 1:** Prevent 1 major outage
- €10,600 outage prevented + 1 year operational savings (€8,250) = €18,850
- ROI: 42% Year 1

**Option 2:** Prevent 1 ransomware incident
- €20,000 risk reduction (20% of €100,000) = Year 1 positive

**Option 3:** Time savings only
- 265 hours saved @ €50/h = €13,250 (break-even)
- 22 hours/month = realistic
